The 2020 ASB Conference was moved to an online format due to COVID-19, so presentations were recorded and uploaded to Youtube. 
You can find the conference abstract [here](http://alcantarar.github.io/files/329_Alcantara_ASB2020_FINAL.pdf) and the video presentation below.
I'm happy to answer any questions on twitter or via email, both can be accessed via links on the sidebar.
