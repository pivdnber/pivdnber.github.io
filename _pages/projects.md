### Sports Sciences updates

In the role of Social Media Editor of Journal of Sports Sciences, I maintain the [@jsportssci Twitter](https://twitter.com/JSportsSci) account and provide daily updates to almost 50.000 followers.

### Open lab days demonstration

I assisted during the open lab days 2016-2019 in the Sport Science Laboratory-Jacques Rogge, Ghent, Belgium. The event aimed to enthuse students about research-grade technologies used in sports sciences. As part of this event, I hosted a demonstration of 3D motion capture with real-time visualization.

### Lab-in-the-field setup

Several of my PhD studies were conducted in the athletic facility of Topsporthal Vlaanderen. Colleagues and I set up a pretty unique lab-in-the-field. It involved built-in force and pressure plates embedded in one of the lanes, and a research-grade indoor position system for immediate speed feedback during the periods of data collection.
