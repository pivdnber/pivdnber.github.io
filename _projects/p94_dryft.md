I developed a an open source python and matlab package that corrects for drift in GRF data from a force plate
or force-measuring treadmill. Signal drift can occur when the treadmill is not warmed up, during
prolonged data collections, and when the force transducers are not zeroed properly. I thought
that these were problems that are prevalent in a lot of biomechanical data and developed this
package to help! You can read the [publication](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01910) 
here or visit the [github page](https://github.com/alcantarar/dryft) to download the package or report bugs. 
If you have research software that you want to distribute, I highly recommend looking into publishing in
an open source software journal like [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/) (Journal of Open Source Software)!
