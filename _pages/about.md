## Hello there!

I am a kinesiologist enthusiastic about human movement, sports injury and performance, assistive technology and reproducibility in science. My research has been about feedback applications, running-related injuries, locomotion mechanics and energetics.

<br>

This site is a bit skeletal since departing to Boston, USA, as I am pursueing post-doctoral research at Spaulding / Harvard Medical School. I'd love to connect with you [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pivdnber/) or [get in touch](mailto:pvdenberghe@mgb.org)!

<br>
