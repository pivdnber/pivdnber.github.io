# Professional services

### #JSS updates

I am the Social Media Editor of Journal of Sports Sciences. In this role I maintain the [@jsportssci Twitter](https://twitter.com/JSportsSci) account and provide daily updates to almost 50.000 followers!

### Popularizing science

I am a huge advocate of communicating technical science to a broad audience and international peers. Multiple actions have been undertaken to his end. Two examples are the pretty popular [VLIR thesis thread](https://twitter.com/SportSciSum/status/1449132653324742657) and the yearly interview with students from the University of Florida as part of their Neuromuscular Aspects of Exercise course.

### Peer review

I aid the scientific process by providing the occasional service of peer review. In the past 12 months I have reviewed for Nature Scientific Reports, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, Journal of Biomechanics, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, Sports biomechanics, Frontiers in Sports and Active Living and Plos One.

# Lab technology

### Open lab days

From 2016 to 2019 I have been assisting during the open lab days at the watersportbaan, Ghent, Belgium. The evented intended to inform and enthuse future students about research-grade technologies in sports sciences. As part of this event I hosted a demonstration of 3D motion capture with real-time visuals in the Sport Science Laboratory-Jacques Rogge.

### Lab-in-the-field

Part of my studies happened outside the lab and in an athletic facility of Topsporthal Vlaanderen, which has track and field training lanes for sportspeople located in Ghent. Colleagues and I set up a pretty unique lab-in-the-field, which involved built-in force and pressure plates in one of the lanes, and a research-grade indoor position system for immediate speed feedback during periods of data collection.

# Time to play?!

### Sports@work

This year I participated in the European Company Sports Games, Ekiden marathon relay (running) and Mr. T Triathlon relay (cycling) as part of the instituational UGent team. I was one of their road captains during the sports afternoon for staff 2022. The yearly bike ride with the Biomechanics of Human movement group have been a real success. Hurray for social sports activities after work!

### The vendange

I volunteered for picking grapes in the historical Province of Beaujolais (France) during the *vendange* of 2019. A fun fact, after bottling, the sparkling wine of the domain Rouge en Beau became a personal gift for my PhD examination committee following graduation.
