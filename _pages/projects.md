### Popularizing science

I am a huge advocate of communicating technical science to a broad audience and international peers. Multiple actions have been undertaken to his end. Few examples are the [VLIR thesis](https://twitter.com/SportSciSum/status/1449132653324742657) and [National Biomechanics Day](https://mobile.twitter.com/SportSciSum/status/1116046786186158086) threads, a yearly invited interview with students from the University of Florida as part of their “Neuromuscular Aspects of Exercise” course.

### Peer review

I aid the scientific process by providing the occasional service of peer review. In the past 12 months I have reviewed for Nature Scientific Reports, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, Journal of Biomechanics, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, Sports biomechanics, Frontiers in Sports and Active Living and Plos One.

## Lab technology

### Open lab days

From 2016 to 2019 I have been assisting during the open lab days at the watersportbaan, Ghent, Belgium. The evented intended to inform and enthuse future students about research-grade technologies in sports sciences. As part of this event I hosted a demonstration of 3D motion capture with real-time visuals in the Sport Science Laboratory-Jacques Rogge.

### Lab-in-the-field

Part of my studies happened outside the lab and in the Topsporthal Vlaanderen, which is an athletic facility for sportspeople in Ghent. Colleagues and I set up a pretty unique lab-in-the-field, which involved built-in force and pressure plates, and a research-grade indoor position system for immediate speed feedback during periods of data collection.

### The vendange

I volunteered for picking grapes in the historical Province of Beaujolais (France) during the *vendange* of 2019. A fun fact, after bottling, the sparkling wine of the domain Rouge en Beau became a personal gift for my PhD examination committee following graduation.
