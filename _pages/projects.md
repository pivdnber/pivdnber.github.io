My passion for science goes beyond the lab and into the digital world. Here's a glimpse into how I've been actively involved in this exciting field:

### Connecting with a Global Audience

As the Social Media Editor for the esteemed Journal of Sports Sciences, I have the privilege of managing the [@jsportssci Twitter](https://twitter.com/JSportsSci) account and provide daily updates to almost 50.000 followers. Sharing the latest discoveries and engaging with a vibrant community of nearly 50,000 followers is so much fun!

I wrote an Editorial about social media use in the sports sciences that you can read [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2024.2305533). 

I enjoy creating visual abstracts like infographics to make complex information accessible to non-scientists, even though they can sometimes lead to oversimplification or misinterpretations. What do you think of the visual abstract shown underneath?

### Inspiring Future Scientists:

From 2016 to 2019, I had the opportunity to contribute to the Open Lab Days at the Sport Science Laboratory-Jacques Rogge in Ghent, Belgium. The event aimed to enthuse students about research-grade technologies used in sports and rehabilitaiton sciences. My role involved showcasing cutting-edge technologies, including a captivating demonstration of 3D motion capture with real-time visualization, sparking curiosity and enthusiasm in aspiring sports scientists.

### Pushing boundaries on the Track

My PhD research took me beyond the traditional lab setting.  Collaborating with colleagues, we established a unique lab-in-the-field environment at the athletic facility of Topsporthal Vlaanderen. Imagine a dedicated lane equipped with built-in force and pressure platforms, coupled with a sophisticated indoor positioning system. This setup allowed us to gather real-time speed feedback, providing invaluable insights for our studies.
