## Running biomechanics, impact loading, and wearable biofeedback

![phdheader](/images/ESBimage.png){:width="600x"}

My PhD research was published as a BJSM PhD Academy Award, which aims "To gather the World's leading PhD graduates to share their research related to sports and exercise medicine.

Rather recently, I was invited by Drs. Peter Düking and Billy Sperlich to summarize several of the studies mentioned below in a book chapter with high quality graphics, published by Springer Nature.

  [A primer on wearable technology for injury risk management in distance running. In: Individualizing Exercise and Training Procedures with Wearable Technologies–Addressing Common Problems of Athletes.](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-45113-3). <br> *Springer Nature*, 2024.

Studies 1 to 5 concerned the development of a new strategy to measure impact continuously in real-time during distance running and to give instantaneous biofeedback to the runner, which enables high -impact runners to self-explore with running style adaptations that can lower impact intensity.

Study 1 lays the foundation of the measurement module for novel wearable technology. It involves a validity-reliability study of peak tibial acceleration as a real-time measure of impact loading in running.

The feedback module is described in study. A musically inspired feedback strategy was developed that distorts music. The level of distortion was logically coupled to the level of impact.

Study 3 delves into the effectiveness testing of the developed feedback prototype for impact reduction. We evaluated it first in a single session to provide proof of concept.

In study 4, we propose a tuned analysis technique to detect time-related changes of impact loading in an individual. The analysis technique allowed to objectify changes otherwise only perceived by the individual.

In study 5, we evaluated the effectiveness of music-based feedback for impact reduction during  running in a 3-week intervention in a rigorous RCT design with controls.

Study 6 is a follow-up of wherein my colleagues and I investigated biomechanical adaptations in high-impact runners who completed a gait retraining program for impact reduction

Study 7 investigated the long-term effects of a 3-week music-based biofeedback intervention on running gait. While the intervention did not lead to lasting changes in impacts, runners were able to recall the trained running style six months later, leading to a substantial reduction in impacts

Studies 8-11 provide insight into possible strategies of low impact running.

In study 8, we classified rear foot strikes into typical and atypical groups using state-of-the art equipment of the Sport Science Laboratory, and compared multiple biomechanical variables between these groups. The typical rearfoot strikers had lower impact severity during level running at a submaximal speed.

The findings from study 9 suggest that 1D peak tibial accelerations depend on the manner of striking the ground with the rear part of the foot.

For study 10, the UGent research unit for Biomechanics of Human Movement had the opportunity to thoroughly describe, compare, and explain the running mechanics of a very successful long-distance runner who demonstrated low load and a high load capacity in comparison with a normative database of runners.

Study 11 investigated the impact of foot strike patterns on tibial accelerations in runners. It was a collaborative effort between international research groups active in academia and industry comprises a rather unique multi-center construct.  The results showed that forefoot strikes had higher peak tibial accelerations compared to rearfoot strikes. This difference is important for applications like running monitoring and biofeedback.

## Exoskeleton-assisted walking and metabolic energy consumption

![phdheader](/images/exowalking.png){:width="600x"}

This study investigated the effects of unilateral and bilateral exoskeleton assistance during walking. Results showed that both unilateral and bilateral assistance reduced the metabolic cost, but bilateral assistance was more effective.  The study highlights the importance of assistance symmetry for maximizing metabolic benefits in exoskeleton-assisted walking.

## Human tissue imaging

I am currently involved in research that uses imaging techniques to study human muscle, bone, and brain tissue. This research is ongoing.
