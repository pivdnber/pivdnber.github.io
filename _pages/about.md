I’m a human movement scientist enthusiastic about sports biomechanics, assistive technology, and reproducibility in science. My general research interests include feedback applications, running-related injuries, locomotion mechanics and energetics.
<br>
<br>
Throughout my M.Sc. I became interested in sports sciences, more specifically in human movement biomechanics and physiology, and completed the minor in scientific research at the research unit for [Biomechanics of Human Movement](https://www.ugent.be/ge/bsw/en/research/biomechanics) in Ghent, Belgium. I received my Ph.D. late 2021 from Ghent University, where I worked in the high-performant [Sport Science Laboratory-Jacques Rogge](https://www.ugent.be/ge/bsw/en/sportlab) founded by professor Dirk De Clercq, who was also my first promotor. The project of my FWO fellowship was ‘Low Impact Running’; a rather unique multi-disciplinary project on music-based feedback in human running that resulted in multiple peer-reviewed [publications](https://pivdnber.github.io/publications/), international [presentations](https://pivdnber.github.io/presentations/), societal research [awards](https://pivdnber.github.io/presentations/), broadcasting on [television](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=287761091944681), and a [patent](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&date=20210819&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP&CC=US&NR=2021252338A1&KC=A1&ND=4) application that is catalyzing an academic [spin-off](https://player.vimeo.com/video/561829521?h=149c9d5643&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963).

# What am I up to?

I'm currently research support staff in the department of [Rehabilitation Sciences](https://www.ugent.be/ge/reva/en) at campus UZ - Ghent University. I recently joined the Editorial Board of the [Journal of Sports Sciences](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=rjsp20&). In my spare time I enjoy outdoors sports, travelling and family festivities.
