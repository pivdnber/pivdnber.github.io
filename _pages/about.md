## Hello there!

I am a research scientist whos interests lie in the fascinating field of human biomechanics and physiology, exploring how our bodies move and function. My research has been about human mechanics and energetics, feedback applications, non-invasive tissue imaging, and sports-related injury.

This site is a bit skeletal since departing to Boston, USA, as I am pursueing post-doctoral research at Spaulding Rehabilitation, Harvard Medical School. I'd love to connect with you [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pivdnber/) or [get in touch](mailto:pvandenberghe@mgb.org)!
