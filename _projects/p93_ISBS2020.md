The 2020 ISBS Conference was moved to an online format due to COVID-19, so presentations were recorded and uploaded to Youtube. Here is my presentation and you can find my conference paper [here](https://commons.nmu.edu/isbs/vol38/iss1/230/), where I found that a prototype running-specific prosthesis improved curved sprinting performance by 0.13 m/s while having no effect on straightaway performance. This pilot study suggests that simple changes to prosthesis design may result in substantial improvements in sprinting performance.
