<br>  
I had a fantastic time visiting a local high school and introducing students to Biomechanics! This was my second year participating in NBD and I'm already making plans for next year. Graduate students from Dr. Enoka and Dr. Grabowski's labs spent the afternoon leading two different "Labs‚Äù:
<br>  
**Lab 1: The Aerodynamics of Skateboarding**  
Students calculated how rapidly one of their classmates skateboarded down the hallway when they were 1) standing upright or 2) crouched down. Students measured frontal area of the skateboarder and calculated velocity and aerodynamic drag force.
<br>  
**Lab 2: [Backyard Brains](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/humanhumaninterface) - Advanced NeuroProsthetics**  
Students learned about generating electromyographic signals and how they can control other devices like a TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator)!
