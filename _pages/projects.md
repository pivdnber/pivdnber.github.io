### #JSS updates

As the Social Media Editor of Journal of Sports Sciences, I maintain the @jsportssci account on Twitter and am providing daily updates to almost 50.000 followers. 

### Open lab days

From 2016 to 2019 I have been assisting during the open lab days at the watersportbaan, Ghent, Belgium. As part of this event I hosted a demonstration of 3D motion capture with real-time visuals in the Sport Science Laboratory-Jacques Rogge.

### Field lab testing

Part of my studies happened outside the lab and in the Topsporthal Vlaanderen, which is an athletic facility for sportspeople in Ghent. Colleagues and I set up a pretty unique lab-in-the-field, which involved built-in force and pressure plates, and a research-grade localisation system for immediate speed feedback indoors.

### Wine *vendange*

I volunteered for a week of picking grapes in the historical Province of Beaujolais in France. A fun fact, when bottled, the sparkling wine of the domain Rouge en Beau became a personal gift to my PhD examination committee following graduation.

### Popularizing science

I am a huge advocate of communicating technical science to a broad audience. Multiple actions have been undertaken to his end. Few examples are the VLIR thesis and National Biomechanics Day threads, a yearly invited meeting with students from the University of Florida to discuss scientific research. 

Furthermore, I try to stimulate the scientific process by providing the occasional service of peer review. In the past 12 months I have reviewed for Nature Scientific Reports, Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, Journal of Biomechanics, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Journal of Applied Biomechanics, Sports biomechanics, Frontiers in Sports and Active Living and Plos One.
